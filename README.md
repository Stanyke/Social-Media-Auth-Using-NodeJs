This is a Google & Facebook OAuth that allows you get users details after getting permission from them to access their data, using it to process user's login or registeration.

**Note:**

Because of the facebook privacy security, the login with facebook is unable to run live using the url/link above but can always run locally offline on port 5000.

Feel free to use it.
